# AminoAcidComposition

#### **A Python-module for encoding proteins or peptides into numerical vectors based on their sequences or structures.**

AminoAcidComposition is a Python-module for generating several numerical representations from protein/peptide sequences and structures. 

AminoAcidComposition includes different amino acid encodings: Distance Frequency, the normal AminoAcidComposition, Quantitative Matrix and Delaunay Triangulation. 

Furthermore, AminoAcidComposition contains two utilities functions that can be used independently, one class contains useful variables and functions and the other class contains functions to generate specific data frames. 

This module also encompasses three machine learning algorithms and four metrics to validate the predictions of machine learning algorithms.


## Installation
In order to run AminoAcidComposition, following Python-packages will be needed:
`Python (Version 3.0 or above)`, `Anaconda (0.8.2)`, `numpy (1.17.0)`, `pandas (0.25.0)`, `sklearn (0.21.2)`,
 `Biopython (1.74)`, `scipy (1.3.1)`, `statistics` and `matplotlib`.
